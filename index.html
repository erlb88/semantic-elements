    <p>What is Semantic HTML?</p>
    <p>Compared to previous versions of HTML with ambiguous structure “div”, every html5 document has an “outline” or “specifics” so the search engines and screen readers can understand in a simple readable way.It’s like a map that you introduce to a kid. A simple map with North, South, East and West is not understandable to a kid level. You should come up with distinct or relatable pictographs like, North is where the polar bear lives, East is where the sun rises, West is where the sun sets, and south (South Pole) is always cold because the sun never rises high in the sky. These distinct or relatable elements <tags> gives or describes what is semantic elements to both the computer browser (machine) and the developer (people) alike. Semantics and the way it’s designed is important to HTML accessibility. If they are not understandable, and not implemented correctly, they are not useful. Using semantic markup results in a standardized code. It can easily be maintained and it will be less confusion if there is a different developer coming to continue or update the html code.</p>

    <p style="color:green;">Everything is <em>green</em></p>
    <p> Everything <strong>seen </strong></p>
    <p> Everything clean! </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Clean <b> pots</b> and shovels </li>
        <li style="color:red">Fresh soil and pebbles </li>
        <li>New seeds to dabble </li>
      </ol>
    <p> Bumble bees unravel</p>
      <ul>
        <li>little rubber boots with wings</li>
        <li>curly tops like springs</li>
        <li> <mark>giggly smiles you bring</mark></li>
